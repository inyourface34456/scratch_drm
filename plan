[X] 1.) obfuscate the code
[ ] 2.) encrypt and decrypt the code at runtime
[ ]     a.) Compile protected code into .so
[ ]     b.) Encrypt .so with openSSL
[ ]         I .) Make sure to save the key in the binary as well
[ ]         II.) I should probly also sign it as well for extra verification
[ ]     c.) Embed .so file in the binary
[ ]     d.) Get and decrypt the .so file
[ ]     e.) Make a virtual filesystem with memfd
[ ]         I  .) Write the file to it
[ ]         II .) make sure to protect it using `O_CLOEXEC`
[ ]         III.) use ftruncate to get the correct size
[ ]         IV .) call dlopen with /proc/self/fd/[fd]
[ ]     f.) Open the .so with dlopen
[ ]         I .) Chat gpt says something like `dlopen("/proc/self/fd/XYZ", RTLD_NOW)`
[ ]     g.) Run the main function in the .so
